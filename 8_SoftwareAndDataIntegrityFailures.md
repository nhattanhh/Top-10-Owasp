# Software and Data Integrity Failures
> When your code or data can be changed by attackers, it can lead to big problems.

- Software and Data Integrity Failures happen when systems don’t make sure that code, updates, or important data haven’t been tampered with. Attackers can change files, inject malicious code, or trick your app into running something dangerous.

## Reason to make Software and Data Integrity Failures Dangerous:
- If attackers can change your code or data, they can add malware, steal information, or take control of your system.

- Supply chain attacks (like when a library you use is hacked) can affect thousands of users at once.

- Data integrity failures can lead to wrong decisions, financial loss, or legal trouble if important records are changed.

- Real-life examples include the SolarWinds attack (where attackers inserted malware into software updates) and ransomware that changes or destroys data.

## Software and Data Integrity Failures Occur:
- Not checking the integrity of software updates or third-party libraries.

- Allowing untrusted sources to upload or change files in your system.

- Not using digital signatures or checksums to verify code and data.

- Not protecting backups or important files from unauthorized changes.

- Using plugins, scripts, or dependencies from unknown or untrusted sources.

## Examples:
- Compromised Update:
    + An attacker changes a software update file:
        ```text
        update.exe is replaced with malware
        ```
    + All users who update get infected.

- Untrusted Plugin:
    + A website installs a plugin from an unknown source:
        ```text
        Downloaded plugin from randomsite.com
        ```
    + The plugin steals user data or adds a backdoor.

- Data Tampering:
    + An attacker changes financial records in a database:
        ```text
        $10,000 payment changed to $100
        ```
    + Causes financial loss and audit problems.

## Consequences of Software and Data Integrity Failures:
- Malware infections and backdoors in your system.

- Data loss, corruption, or manipulation.

- Loss of trust, legal issues, and business disruption.

- Large-scale supply chain attacks affecting many users.

## Preventive Measures:
- Use digital signatures and checksums to verify software and data integrity.

- Only use trusted sources for updates, plugins, and dependencies.

- Protect backups and important files from unauthorized changes (set strict permissions).

- Monitor for unexpected changes in code, configuration, or data.

- Review and test third-party code before using it in production.

- Use automated tools to scan for integrity issues and supply chain risks.

### Tips:
- Enable automatic alerts for changes to critical files or configurations.
- Regularly audit your dependencies and remove unused or risky ones.
- Educate your team about the risks of downloading code from untrusted sources.
- Keep a record (hashes, signatures) of important files and check them often.
- Use version control systems (like Git) to track changes in code and configuration.

## Conclusion:
Software and Data Integrity Failures can let attackers change your code or data, leading to serious damage. By verifying everything you use, protecting important files, and staying alert for changes, you can keep your systems and data safe from tampering and supply chain attacks!
